<span style="font-size: 62px; line-height: 90%;">looks like a lot</span>
<span style="font-size: 52px; line-height: 95%;">of text to read. </span>
<span style="font-size: 42px; line-height: 100%;">But I could only think</span>
<span style="font-size: 32px; line-height: 100%;">of one way to explain my</span>
<span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 120%;">point, and that's by asking you to read a</span>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 140%;">large block of text. As you, I want to know which color scheme is better for my eyes and productivity, the dark-on-light or the light-on-dark. Then I found a very informed discussion <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/498698/white-light-vs-black-dark-backgrounds-health-effects">here</a>. Most of them think dark-on-light is better for reading. But some people think light-on-dark is less visual fatigue for long time reading. The best way to know the answer is try it yourself. So someone suggest this very interesting <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/owmyeyes/">site</a>. It's provide two modes: black-on-white and white-on-black. When you use the white-on-black mode, as the author says, "By now you may be seeing the ghosts of previous lines every time your eyes skip to the next line. When you move on to another site, you'll see a lingering image of this web page superimposed over whatever you look at. For many people, it's a dizzying experience." and the other mode is much better. So you think you've got the answer after compare those two modes? Maybe not. I think light-on-dark is not only white-on-black. We can have more choices. <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> scheme is very popular around hackers, I use solarized to rewrite that site. Two more modes were added, one dark-background and one light-background. You can choose different mode below. The solarized light-on-dark(not white-on-black) give me the best feeling. Which is your favorite one? Please let me know. Thank you.</span>
